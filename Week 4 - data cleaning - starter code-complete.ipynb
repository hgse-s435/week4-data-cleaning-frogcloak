       "'Zone out no more: Mitigating mind wandering during\\ncomputerized reading\\nSidney K. D’Mello, Caitlin Mills, Robert Bixler, & Nigel Bosch\\nUniversity of Notre Dame\\n118 Haggar Hall\\nNotre Dame, IN 46556, USA\\nsdmello@nd.edu\\n\\nABSTRACT\\nMind wandering, defined as shifts in attention from task-related\\nprocessing to task-unrelated thoughts, is a ubiquitous\\nphenomenon that has a negative influence on performance and\\nproductivity in many contexts, including learning. We propose\\nthat next-generation learning technologies should have some\\nmechanism to detect and respond to mind wandering in real-time.\\nTowards this end, we developed a technology that automatically\\ndetects mind wandering from eye-gaze during learning from\\ninstructional texts. When mind wandering is detected, the\\ntechnology intervenes by posing just-in-time questions and\\nencouraging re-reading as needed. After multiple rounds of\\niterative refinement, we summatively compared the technology to\\na yoked-control in an experiment with 104 participants. The key\\ndependent variable was performance on a post-reading\\ncomprehension assessment. Our results suggest that the\\ntechnology was successful in correcting comprehension deficits\\nattributed to mind wandering (d = .47 sigma) under specific\\nconditions, thereby highlighting the potential to improve learning\\nby “attending to attention.”\\n\\nKeywords\\nMind wandering; gaze tracking; student modeling; attentionaware.\\n\\n1. INTRODUCTION\\nDespite our best efforts to write a clear and engaging paper,\\nchances are high that within the next 10 pages you might fall prey\\nto what is referred to as zoning out, daydreaming, or mind\\nwandering [45]. Despite your best intention to concentrate on our\\npaper, at some point your attention might drift away to unrelated\\nthoughts of lunch, childcare, or an upcoming trip. This prediction\\nis not based on some negative or cynical opinion of the\\nreader/reviewer (we read and review papers too), but on what is\\nknown about attentional control, vigilance, and concentration\\nwhile individuals are engaged in complex comprehension\\nactivities, such as reading for understanding.\\nOne recent study tracked mind wandering of 5,000 individuals\\nfrom 83 countries with a smartphone app that prompted people\\nwith thought-probes at random intervals throughout the day [24].\\nPeople reported mind wandering for 46.9% of the prompts, which\\nconfirmed lab studies on the pervasiveness of mind wandering\\n(see [45] for a review). Mind wandering is more than merely\\nincidental; a recent meta-analysis of 88 samples indicated a\\nnegative correlation between mind wandering and performance\\nacross a variety of tasks [34], a correlation which increases with\\ntask complexity. When compounded with its high frequency,\\nmind wandering can have serious consequences on the\\nperformance and productivity of society at large.\\n\\nof learning with technology. Traditional learning technologies\\nrely on the assumption that students are attending to the learning\\nsession, although this is not always the case. For example, it has\\nbeen estimated that students mind wander approximately 40% of\\nthe time when engaging with online lectures [38], which are an\\nimportant component of MOOCs. Some advanced technologies\\ndo aim to detect and respond to affective states like boredom, but\\nevidence for their effectiveness is still equivocal (see [9] for a\\nreview). Further, boredom is related to but not the same as\\nattention [12]. There are technologies that aim to prevent mind\\nwandering by engendering a highly immersive learning\\nexperience and have achieved some success in this regard [40,\\n41]. But what is to be done when attentional focus inevitably\\nwanes as the session progresses and the novelty of the system and\\ncontent fades?\\nOur central thesis is that next-generation learning technologies\\nshould include mechanisms to model and respond to learners’\\nattention in real-time [8]. Such attention-aware technologies can\\nmodel various aspects of learner attention (e.g., divided attention,\\nalternating attention). Here, we focus on detecting and mitigating\\nmind wandering, a quintessential signal of waning engagement.\\nWe situate our work in the context of reading because reading is\\na common activity shared across multiple learning technologies,\\nthereby increasing the generalizability of our results. Further,\\nstudents mind wander approximately 30% of the time during\\ncomputerized reading [44]. And although mind wandering can\\nfacilitate certain cognitive processes like future planning and\\ndivergent thinking [2, 28], it negatively correlates with\\ncomprehension and learning (reviewed in [31, 45]), suggesting\\nthat it is important to address mind wandering during learning.\\nTowards this end, we developed and validated a closed-loop\\nattention-aware learning technology that combines a machinelearned mind wandering detector with a real-time interpolated\\ntesting and re-study intervention. Our attention-aware technology\\nworks as follows. Learners read a text on a computer screen using\\na self-paced screen-by-screen (also called page-by-page) reading\\nparadigm. We track eye-gaze during reading using a remote eye\\ntracker that does not restrict head movements. We focus on eyegaze for mind wandering detection due to decades of research\\nsuggesting a tight coupling between attentional focus and eye\\nmovements during reading [36]. When mind wandering is\\ndetected, the system intervenes in an attempt to redirect\\nattentional focus and correct any comprehension deficits that\\nmight arise due to mind wandering. The interventions consist of\\nasking comprehension question on pages where mind wandering\\nwas detected and providing opportunities to re-read based on\\nlearners’ responses. In this paper, we discuss the mind wandering\\n\\nMind wandering is also unfortunately an under-addressed\\nproblem in education and is yet to be deeply studied in the context\\n\\nProceedings of the 10th International Conference on Educational Data Mining\\n\\n8\\n\\n'"

       "'the parameters to suggest learning is occurring when it may\\nnot be. another way to proceed is to consider alternative\\nstudent models, which is an active area of educational data\\nmining research. perhaps, obtaining semantically degenerate\\nparameters from a fit should signal that our students may\\nbe learning in more complicated ways than the simple bkt\\nmodel can predict, and so we should try to find alternative\\nmodels that fit our data better without yielding semantically\\ndegenerate parameters. finally, even if our model is semantically degenerate, it does not necessarily make the bkt\\nmodel useless. the result of fitting a bkt model is that we\\nget the best fit of the data given that we are modeling the\\ndata with a two-state hmm (if we disregard local optima).\\npresumably, such a model can give us some insights about\\nstudent learning even if it is not modeling student mastery.\\nso perhaps we can use such semantically degenerate models\\nto understand student learning rather than to predict student\\nmastery.\\n\\n5.\\n\\nconclusion\\n\\nwe have explored the issues of identifiability and semantic\\nmodel degeneracy in bayesian knowledge tracing. we have\\nshown that what researchers posited was an identifiability\\nproblem is actually not an identifiability problem, and by\\nusing a result from the literature on learning hidden markov\\nmodels, we showed that an identifiability problem does not\\nexist for bkt models (with the exception of some mathematically degenerate cases that should not come up in practice).\\nwe then examined the various issues with fitting bkt models that have been conflated with identifiability. we offered\\nwhat we believe to be new insights on one potential source of\\nsemantic model degeneracy. we believe analyzing the sources\\nof semantic model degeneracy in more detail can be a fruitful\\ndirection for future research. for example, it could be useful\\nto know what bkt parameters result from fitting various\\nother popular models of student learning. it would also be\\ninformative to see if we can find automated ways of detecting\\nwhich assumptions of bkt are not met in our data (e.g., the\\nnumber of levels of mastery, the independence of different\\nskills). such analyses could help in devising better student\\nmodels, and ultimately may lead to a better

      "we have three main findings. first, we demonstrated that a\n",
      "machine-learned mind wandering detector built in one context\n",
      "can be applied to a different (albeit related) interaction context.\n",
      "specifically, the detector was trained on a data set involving\n",
      "participants silently reading and self-reporting mind wandering,\n",
      "but was applied to an interactive context involving interpolated\n",
      "assessments, which engendered different reading strategies.\n",
      "further, self-reports of mind wandering were not collected in this\n",
      "interactive context, which might have influenced mind wandering\n",
      "rates in and of itself. despite these differences, we were able to\n",
      "demonstrate the predictive validity of the detector by showing\n",
      "that it negatively correlated with both online and offline\n",
      "comprehension scores when evaluated on new participants.\n",
      "second, we showed promising effects for our intervention\n",
      "approach despite a very conservative experimental design, which\n",
      "ensured that the intervention and control groups were equated\n",
      "along all respects, except that the intervention was triggered based\n",
      "on the mind wandering detector (key manipulation). further, we\n",
      "used a probabilistic approach to trigger an intervention, because\n",
      "the detector is inherently imperfect. as a result, participants could\n",
      "have received an intervention when they were not mind\n",
      "wandering and/or could have failed to receive one when they were\n",
      "mind wandering. therefore, it was essential to compare the two\n",
      "groups under conditions when the mind wandering levels\n",
      "differed. this more nuanced analysis revealed that although the\n",
      "intervention itself did not lead to a boost in overall comprehension\n",
      "(because it is remedial), it equated comprehension scores when\n",
      "mind wandering was high (i.e., scores for the intervention group\n",
      "were comparable when the control group was low on mind\n",
      "wandering). it also demonstrated the cost of not intervening\n",
      "during mind wandering (i.e., scores for the intervention group\n",
      "were greater when the control group was high on mind\n",
      "wandering). in other words, the intervention was successful in\n",
      "mitigating the negative effects of mind wandering.\n",
      "third, despite the advantages articulated above, the intervention\n",
      "itself was reactive and engendered several unintended (and\n",

      "there are a number of methodological limitations with this work\n",
      "that go beyond limitations with the intervention (as discussed\n",

      "features. however, given that several supervised classifiers are\n",
      "very sensitive to differences in base rates, the detector might overor under- predict mind wandering when applied to texts that\n",
      "engender different rates of mind wandering. therefore, retraining\n",
